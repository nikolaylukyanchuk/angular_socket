Test angular javascript developer test

Desciption:
In this test work I tried to show my technology stack:
I used websocket (socket.io) instead of ajax calls. 
I wrote angularjs custom directives, filters, service, controller, used predefined directives (animate, pluralize) and shown how to work with emit/on events

Consumer - service - see /public/javascripts/services (consumerService)
   get new messages from server, send this messages to presenter
Presenter - custom directive - see /public/javascripts/directives (presenter)
   get new messages from Consumer and display them on html, user can manage showing time by changing lifetime directive parameter

One more point, the reason I dont like to use code comments, because code should be clear and understandable without any additional text information.
